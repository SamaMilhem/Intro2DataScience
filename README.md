# üåüüß† **A Needle in a Data Haystack: Introduction to Data Science** - Course 67978

Welcome to my coursework repository for the **Introduction to Data Science (Course 67978)** at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This repository contains all exercises designed to explore the field of data science through practical applications.

### üíª **Exercises**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exercise 1: TF-IDF, PageRank, and K-Means Clustering on Fruit Wikipedia Pages**

This exercise combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **clustering** techniques. The objective is to analyze Wikipedia pages about different fruits by applying:

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A text-mining technique to measure the importance of words in a document relative to a larger corpus.
- **PageRank**: An algorithm originally developed by Google to rank web pages, here used for summarizing content.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar objects based on shared features.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exercise 2: Text Analysis and Processing of *Little Women***

This exercise focuses on **text preprocessing** and analysis using Louisa May Alcott's *Little Women*. The key techniques include:

- **Tokenization**: Dividing text into smaller, meaningful units (like words or phrases).
- **Stopword Removal**: Eliminating common, less-informative words from the analysis.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Classifying words into their respective parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb).
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Exploring Zipf‚Äôs Law, which describes the frequency of words in natural language.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Visualizing frequently occurring terms in a fun and engaging way.
