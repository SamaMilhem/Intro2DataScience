### üíª **Exercises**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exercise 1: TF-IDF, PageRank, and K-Means Clustering on Fruit Wikipedia Pages**

In this exercise, we dive into a mix of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **clustering** techniques. The aim is to analyze Wikipedia pages of various fruits using:

- **TF-IDF**: A common text-mining technique for information retrieval.
- **PageRank**: Originally developed by Google to rank web pages, applied here for summarization.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm to group similar objects based on features.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exercise 2: Text Analysis and Processing of *Little Women***

This exercise revolves around **text preprocessing** and analysis techniques, using Louisa May Alcott's classic novel, *Little Women*. Key components include:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking the text into smaller parts.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words that don't contribute to the analysis.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base form.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying word classes like nouns and verbs.
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Investigating Zipf‚Äôs Law to understand word distributions.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Creating visual representations of frequently used terms.
